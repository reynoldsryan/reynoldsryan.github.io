&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned what recursion is and how to write recursive functions &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented 15 underscore.js functions&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Implemented stack and queue using the four instantiation patterns &lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;functional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;functional-shared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prototypal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pseudoclassical&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilized pair programming as both driver and navigator for all of the above (I really like coding this way!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned about lexical scoping and closure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used github daily to push my code to my repos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned how to create an algorithm to solve a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went over coding best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examined function binding and how to use "this"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I was never happy drafting contracts on a daily basis, so I wanted to take a step back to reflect on what I do enjoy doing so I could find a way to incorporate that in to my next job.  So here we are after six or so months of soul searching, and a love of technology combined with a desire to build something in order to scratch that creative itch that wasn't satisfied while practicing law has led me to web development. Thus, the name for this blog - a mix of Lorem Ipsum (developer pseudo latin nonsense) and Res Ipsa Loquitur (a legal term meaning "the thing speaks for itself") - so roughly translating to Lorem Ipsum Speaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday was my first day at MakerSquare, a coding school in LA that focuses on JavaScript.  My experience with coding before this was a month of self study followed by a month of night class to make sure I wanted to make the time and financial commitment that is being a student at MakerSquare. I really enjoyed coding and so here I am just starting a marathon to learn as much about JavaScript as I can 12 to 14 hours a day, six days a week, for the next three months - so all told roughly around 1000 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am starting this blog to keep track of what I'm learning since the days are already flying by and the pace is breakneck so I don't want to look back six weeks from now and forget how I got there. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>Welcome to Ghost</title><description>&lt;p&gt;You're live!

Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;your blog URL&amp;gt;/ghost/&lt;/code&gt;. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="gettingstarted"&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use &lt;em&gt;shortcuts&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;style&lt;/strong&gt; your content. For example, a list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item number one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item number two
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A nested item&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A final item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or with numbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember to buy some milk  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drink the milk  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id="links"&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like &lt;a href="http://ghost.org"&gt;http://ghost.org&lt;/a&gt; - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to &lt;a href="http://ghost.org"&gt;the Ghost website&lt;/a&gt;. Neat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="whataboutimages"&gt;What about Images?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="quoting"&gt;Quoting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ghost - Just a blogging platform&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id="workingwithcode"&gt;Working with Code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id="readyforabreak"&gt;Ready for a Break?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h3 id="advancedusage"&gt;Advanced Usage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
