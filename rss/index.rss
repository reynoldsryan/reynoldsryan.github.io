And I mean that in the best possible way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past four days, I've done the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned what recursion is and how to write recursive functions &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented 15 underscore.js functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented stack and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/recursion-re-implementing-underscore-js-data-structures/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">d7302883-7317-4dfc-b869-aea2b2e9422c</guid><dc:creator>Ryan Reynolds</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 06:43:41 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I've only been at MakerSquare for four days and it feels like four weeks.

&lt;li&gt;Implemented stack and queue using the four instantiation patterns &lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;functional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;functional-shared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;prototypal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pseudoclassical&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilized pair programming as both driver and navigator for all of the above (I really like coding this way!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned about lexical scoping and closure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used github daily to push my code to my repos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned how to create an algorithm to solve a problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Went over coding best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examined function binding and how to use "this"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I was never happy drafting contracts on a daily basis, so I wanted to take a step back to reflect on what I do enjoy doing so I could find a way to incorporate that in to my next job.  So here we are after six or so months of soul searching, and a love of technology combined with a desire to build something in order to scratch that creative itch that wasn't satisfied while practicing law has led me to web development. Thus, the name for this blog - a mix of Lorem Ipsum (developer pseudo latin nonsense) and Res Ipsa Loquitur (a legal term meaning "the thing speaks for itself") - so roughly translating to Lorem Ipsum Speaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday was my first day at MakerSquare, a coding school in LA that focuses on JavaScript.  My experience with coding before this was a month of self study followed by a month of night class to make sure I wanted to make the time and financial commitment that is being a student at MakerSquare. I really enjoyed coding and so here I am just starting a marathon to learn as much about JavaScript as I can 12 to 14 hours a day, six days a week, for the next three months - so all told roughly around 1000 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am starting this blog to keep track of what I'm learning since the days are already flying by and the pace is breakneck so I don't want to look back six weeks from now and forget how I got there. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
