            <p>After five years of practicing law, I quit my corporate law job to decide what I wanted to do with my life.  I was never happy drafting contracts on a daily basis, so I wanted to take a step back to reflect on what I do enjoy doing so I could find a way to incorporate that in to my next job.  So here we are after six or so months of soul searching, and a love of technology combined with a desire to build something in order to scratch that creative itch that wasn't satisfied while practicing law has led me to web development. Thus, the name for this blog - a mix of Lorem Ipsum (developer pseudo latin nonsense) and Res Ipsa Loquitur (a legal term meaning "the thing speaks for itself") - so roughly translating to Lorem Ipsum Speaks.</p>

<p>Monday was my first day at MakerSquare, a coding school in LA that focuses on JavaScript.  My experience with coding before this was a month of self study followed by a month of night class to make sure I wanted to make the time and financial commitment that is being a student at MakerSquare. I really enjoyed coding and so here I am just starting a marathon to learn as much about JavaScript as I can 12 to 14 hours a day, six days a week, for the next three months - so all told roughly around 1000 hours.</p>

<p>I am starting this blog to keep track of what I'm learning since the days are already flying by and the pace is breakneck so I don't want to look back six weeks from now and forget how I got there. </p>
